<h1 align="center">File/Directory Search Script</h1>

![Preview](Peek-View.gif)

## Why use it?

### Search for files or directories by name
###  Choose between exact matches or partial containment
### Recursive search through all subdirectories
### Simple interactive command-line interface
### Fast scanning using native Python `os.walk()`

## Installation
1. Make sure you are on Linux
2. Confirm that Python 3 is installed
3. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/DelorianCS/search-script.git
cd search-script
python search.py
```
You can also add it as a command like this
```
nano ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc
```
And add this at the very end
```
search() {python3 /CHANGE-THIS-TO-DIRECTORY/search.py}
```
And now you can do `search` on your terminal and use the script from there!

## Usage
  Basic Usage
```
  Where do you want to search?:
```
  Select a directory (e.g. "/home/user/Downloads/"
```
  Are you looking for a file or a directory?
```
  Select which one you want to search for (file/directory)
  ```
  What name are you looking for?
```
  Select what name you want to search for `(e.g. flag)`


**CAREFUL**, do not type the file extension 
  
- ❌ Incorrect usage `(file.txt)`   
    
- ✅️ Correct usage `(file)` 
```
  Should the name match exactly or just contain it?
```
  Pick one (exact/contain)
